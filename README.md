# TankMonitor

This is an ASP.NET Core application that has been designed to run on Microsoft's Azure systems. It presents the most current inventory levels on file for each store in the database. Use the UploadGallons script file in my other GitHub project to poll the stores and add the tank volumes to the sites.

I created this as part of a school project and then extended it for some extra practice with Visual Studio, ASP.NET Core and Microsoft Azure services.
